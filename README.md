### How to hook method?

##### Simple to use
```kotlin
KXposedHelpers.findAndHookMethod(Activity::class, "onCreate", parameterTypes = arrayOf(Bundle::class), methodHook = MethodHook{param->
    // `this` for the Activity instance
    // So you can write code just like in your regular way on Activity
    // For exmaple
    Toast.makeText(this,"onStart",Toast.LENGTH_SHORT).show()
})
```

#### Before and after hook
```kotlin
KXposedHelpers.findAndHookMethod(Activity::class, "onStart", methodHook = MethodHook(
    beforeHookedMethod = { param->
    },
    afterHookedMethod = { param->
    })
)
```

#### Replece method
```kotlin
KXposedHelpers.findAndHookMethod(Activity::class, "onStart", methodHook = MethodReplecement{param->
})
```

#### Change return value
```kotlin
KXposedHelpers.findAndHookMethod(TextView::class, "getText", methodHook = MethodHook{param->
    param.result = "Changed result value"
})
```

#### Some utilities in hook
```kotlin
// ActivityHookHelper for Activity lifecycle hook
ActivityHookHelper.onCreate {  }
ActivityHookHelper.onDestroy {  }
...

// ApplicationHookHelper
ApplicationHookHelper.onCreate {  }
ApplicationHookHelper.attach {  }
```

### How to use KXSharedPreferences?
In high Android version, because the security permission, and the  XSharedPreferences not working very well, so I created the utility for SharedPreferences called KXSharedPreferences, it's use the ContentProvider to shared preferences across the applications.

Step 1. Add the provider to your AndroidManifest.xml
```xml
<provider
    android:authorities="io.ikws4.kxposedhelper.utilities.KXSharedPreferencesProvider"
    android:name="io.ikws4.kxposedhelper.utilities.KXSharedPreferencesProvider"
    android:exported="true"/>
```

Step 2. Use the KXSharedPreferences object to get SharedPreferences value.
```kotlin
val sp = KXSharedPreferences(contentResolver,"your SharedPreferences name")
sp.getString("key","defValue")
```

### How to use KXBroadcastReceiver?
Sometimes you need to receive some broadcasts from your app, so this can help you easily to receiver broadcasts.

```kotlin
val broadReceiver = KXBroadcastReceiver(
    IntentFilter().apply {
        addAction("Action1")
        addAction("Action2")
    })

broadReceiver.setOnReceiveListener { context, intent ->
    when (intent.action) {
        "Action1" -> {
        }
        "Action2" -> {
        }
    }
}

ActivityHookHelper.onCreate {
    broadReceiver.register(this)
}

ActivityHookHelper.onDestroy {
    broadReceiver.unRegister(this)
}
```
